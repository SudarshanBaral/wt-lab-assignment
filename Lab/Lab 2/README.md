Buttons - The <button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog
  
  
Border - The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It sets the values of border-width, border-style, and border-color.
          border: 2px dashed green; is how you define border where 2px is border-width , dashed is border-style and green is border-color.

hover - The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally                 triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).
  
active(press) -The :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically                    starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.

disabled - If the disabled attribute is specified on a form control, the element and its form control descendants do not participate in constraint validation. Often                browsers grey out such controls and it won't receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus-related ones.
